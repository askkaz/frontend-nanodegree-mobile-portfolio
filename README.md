To resize the pizzas on pizza.html, drag the slider to choose small, medium, or large pizzas.

The optimizations made in main.js include:
-calculating pizza size only once per re-size, instead of on every single element
-calculating the scrollTop value only once, instead of at each pizza (when scrolling)
-calculating the phases for the scrolling only once per phase (0-5), instead of over and over again
-pre-capitalizing nouns and adjectives instead of doing it each time they are used
-minifying the main.js and html js code
